The main code for the application's different screens can be found in the "lib" folder.

The hardware's code can be found in the "ESP32" folder.

Because of the hardware's limitation, some elements from the PSSC are not doable. The user can't choose from four different smells, as the hardware contains only three smells.
Same for the intensity choice, as there is only three levels possible. Putting more option would not make sense, as there would not be much difference between them.
Thus said, it would be easy to change the parameters, and have more smells, and more intensity levels.
